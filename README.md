# odin-recipes
This is the first project in The Odin Project for the HTML Basics module.
The three recipes I used are:
1. Snert (Dutch split pea soup)
2. Apple Pie
3. Baked Spaghetti

This project consists of a main page and 3 recipes with a picture, ingredients, and step-by-step directions.
This project taught me how to create a github repo, how to make and organize basic html pages and how to use some elements in html such as 
ordered and unordered lists, headers, links, and images
