    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 (16 ounce) package spaghetti </li>
      <li>1 pound ground beef </li>
      <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
      <li>1 (32 ounce) jar meatless spaghetti sauce</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon seasoned salt</li>
      <li>1/3 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>

    <ol>
      <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
      <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. Drain.</li>
